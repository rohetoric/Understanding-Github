Hello World!
How do you do?
I have come here to understand Github!
I have studied in Rajhans Vidyalaya where I used to get coached in Rao IIT!
I have studied in DAV Public School, Pune where I completed my 10th standard.
I did go to Symbiosis, Nashik too. Beautiful school. Then I moved to Pune to join DAV.
I also went to DPS Gandhidham which was also a fanstastic experience. Really gave me confidence that anything can be achieved in life if we have the courage and self determination.
When I was in Mumbai I studied in RN Podar School. Had a tough time here too. Lived in Santacruz.
