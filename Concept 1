Hello World!
How do you do?
I have come here to understand Github!
I have studied in Rajhans Vidyalaya where I used to get coached in Rao IIT!
I have studied in DAV Public School, Pune where I completed my 10th standard.
I did go to Symbiosis, Nashik too. Beautiful school. Then I moved to Pune to join DAV.
